What is Pandas? Pandas is a library for data manipulation that is built on top of the Python programming language. 
Pandas has in-built functions for virtually anything you wish to do with your data such as selecting specific columns or rows, handling missing data, 
grouping and sorting, merging different data frames and much more.

Pandas is built on top of the NumPy package, meaning a lot of the structure of NumPy is used or replicated in Pandas.
Data in pandas is often used to feed statistical analysis in SciPy, plotting functions from Matplotlib, and machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn.
